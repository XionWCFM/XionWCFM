## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools

I enjoy working with frontend development productivity tools. Below is a list of the technology stack I am particularly confident in.

- **Frontend Frameworks/Libraries:**  I primarily use  ![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white) and ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white) I often enjoy looking into the source code of these open sources and have a decent understanding of their operating principles at the code level.
- **Languages:** I love ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178c6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white),I aim for strictly type-safe code and do not hesitate to make efforts to achieve it.
- **Styling:**  I am a fervent fan of the utility-first philosophy of ![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/TailwindCSS-06B6D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white) I love the TailwindCSS ecosystem and have even tried building my own design tokens and TailwindCSS plugins.
- **Build Tools & Package Managers:** I prefer ![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yarn-2C8EBB?style=for-the-badge&logo=yarn&logoColor=white) but am not limited to any specific package manager. My choice of build tool is centered around performance and developer experience.
